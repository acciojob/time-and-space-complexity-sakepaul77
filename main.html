    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity in Algorithms</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how the execution time of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. A more efficient algorithm will have a lower time complexity, making it faster as the input size increases.
    </p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run as a function of the input size. It is often expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size.
