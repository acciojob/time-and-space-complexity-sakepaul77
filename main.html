    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize the time complexity to ensure faster performance, especially with large data sets.
    </p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires in relation to the input size. It is typically measured using the Big-O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input.
